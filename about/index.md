### Hi, I'm Michael G. Mayoral

I'm a System Administrator that loves PowerShell, automating, and everything DevOps. I like to explore ways to implement DevOps practices in places without the "Devs", or how I like to call it "Ops by Code".

**About this Blog**

Yes, itâ€™s another Blog! It's a place for me to to share my notes, ideas, and my own "technical reference". You can find scripts and snippets that I have found around the web and have helped me become a better scripter. This blog is a place where I can give back to you, the IT community, and any curious mind that wishes to learn something new. My hope is you can find value within these pages so we're able to to continue growing together.
